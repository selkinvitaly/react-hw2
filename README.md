It's the second homework for react course

This build uses [gulp 4 version](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/tree/4.0), so you need to install it:
```sh
npm i -g gulpjs/gulp#4.0
```

# Usage

The development build:
```sh
npm run build:dev
```
The production build:
```sh
npm run build:prod
```
The development build with the webpack-dev-server start:
```sh
npm run watch
```
